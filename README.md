# SQL-for-ratio-manipulation
This is the first step of a much larger research project I commenced in 2014 to investigate equity (share) trading strategies, which includes the following steps:
1) Manipulation of ratios in SQL Server (creation of independent variables or features) (this repository)
2) Matching of data observations from step 1) with subsequent stock returns (dependant variables or targets)
3) Searching for profitable trading strategies using simple sorting procedures
4) Searching for profitable trading strategies using linear programming optimisation
5) Dashboard-type application to allow for variations in research design
6) Searching for profitable trading strategies using machine-learning algorithms

This repository contains SQL statements, including stored procedures, to compute financial & market ratios and store the output in 2 output tables in a form more suitable for the following steps. Further details to understand the SQL statements in this repository (e.g. table schemas, data description) is in the word document "Further informtion".
