This task is part of a much larger research project I commenced in 2014 to investigate equity (share) trading strategies. Data were obtained for ASX stocks covering the period 2000 to 2013 and stored and processed using Microsoft SQL Server. This data includes company financials (i.e. annual financial statement data), and market-based data (i.e. derived from ASX data such as price, volume, shares outstanding etc.). In this task I compute financial ratios and other ‘signals’ and store them in tables suitable for use in later tasks such as<br>
*Searching for profitable trading strategies based on these ratios
*Analysing changes in ASX200 index membership, with a view to predicting and trading off these changes
*Creation of a Python (Tkinter) based application to allow for variations in research design
*Searching for profitable trading strategies using machine-learning algorithms

This repository contains SQL statements, including stored procedures, to compute financial & market ratios and store the output in 2 output tables in a form more suitable for the following steps. Further details to understand the SQL statements in this repository (e.g. table schemas, data description) is in the PDF "Further informtion".
