# SQL-for-ratio-manipulation
This is the first step of a much larger research project I commenced in 2014 to investigate equity (share) trading strategies, which includes the following steps:
1) Manipulation of ratios in SQL Server (creation of independent variables or features) (this repository)
2) Analysing changes in ASX200 index membership, with a view to prediction
3) Creation of a Python (Tkinter) based application to allow for variations in research design
4) Searching for profitable trading strategies using simple sorting procedures
5) Searching for profitable trading strategies using machine-learning algorithms

This repository contains SQL statements, including stored procedures, to compute financial & market ratios and store the output in 2 output tables in a form more suitable for the following steps. Further details to understand the SQL statements in this repository (e.g. table schemas, data description) is in the PDF "Further informtion".
